# Traversing a linked list
 This includes verilog code where we traverse a doubly linked list of ghats of Varanasi to find the least time being spent among all the ghats and the ghat at which time spent is the least.

 Following is another file where little encryption is added to data of linked list through hashing and we have traversed the linked list(this time linked list is converted from doubly to single linked list) to find the infinite loop, if created by a hacker by little change in the data.
